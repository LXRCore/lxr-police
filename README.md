---

## **Configurable Features**

### **Blip and Job Configurations**
```lua
Config.ShowBlips = true

Config.EvidenceJobs = {
    police = true
}
Config.BlipsJobs = {
    police = true, 
    ambulance = true
}
Config.Law = {
    police = true, 
    sheriff = true
}
```
- **BlipsJobs**: Define jobs that will have blips visible on the map.
- **EvidenceJobs**: Define jobs authorized to interact with the evidence system.

### **Locations**  
You can configure the locations for police stations, duty points, armories, evidence storage, and more.

```lua
Config.Locations = {
    duty = {
        vector3(1362.05, -1301.83, 77.77),  -- Valentine
        vector3(2507.53, -1301.41, 48.95),  -- Saint Denis
        vector3(-768.03, -1266.37, 44.05),  -- Blackwater
        vector3(-1812.03, -354.09, 164.65)  -- Strawberry
    },
    armory = {
        vector3(1361.16, -1305.7, 77.76),
        vector3(2494.53, -1304.32, 48.95),
        vector3(-764.86, -1272.43, 44.04),
        vector3(-1813.93, -354.78, 164.65)
    },
    stations = {
        { label = "Sheriff", coords = vector3(1360.88, -1301.53, 77.77) },
        { label = "Saint Denis Police Dept. HQ", coords = vector3(2501.83, -1309.04, 48.95) },
        { label = "Blackwater Police Dept.", coords = vector3(-760.47, -1269.14, 44.04) },
        { label = "Strawberry Sheriff", coords = vector3(-1810.57, -350.91, 164.66) }
    }
}
```
- You can add or modify these locations to fit the roleplay map of your server.

### **Armory Items Configuration**  
Set up different items in the police armory, from weapons to ammo and specialized tools.

```lua
Config.Items = {
    label = "Police Armory",
    slots = 30,
    items = {
        {
            name = "weapon_revolver_cattleman",
            price = 0,
            amount = 1,
            info = { serie = "" },
            type = "weapon",
            slot = 1,
            authorizedJobGrades = { 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 }
        },
        {
            name = "weapon_repeater_winchester",
            price = 0,
            amount = 1,
            info = { serie = "" },
            type = "weapon",
            slot = 2,
            authorizedJobGrades = { 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 }
        }
    }
}
```
- **AuthorizedJobGrades**: This allows specific job grades (e.g., ranks) to access the items.

### **Evidence System**
The evidence system allows officers to interact with objects placed at crime scenes. The range for collecting evidence is configurable.

```lua
Config.EvidenceRange = 2.5  -- Range for interacting with evidence
```
